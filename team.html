    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <img src="img/team1.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>A legend is born...</h2>
    <button class="accordion">READ MORE</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>A group of friends congregated on this bench. They all possessed a shared passion for football, a special game that had recently been ‘imported’ from England. They had an intriguing idea, to create a sports club. The boys attended the ‘Massimo D’Azeglio’ high school which specialised in classical studies. They were well educated but the eldest was just 17 years of age. This paved the way for the club’s name. In Latin, the name ‘Juventus’ means youth. They weren’t aware of it yet, but on 1 November 1897, they had given birth to a legend.

            And so Italy’s greatest football team was born, almost by chance. The club’s first President was Enrico Canfari, the first ground was Piazza d’Armi (Parade Ground) and the side started out wearing pink. Sporting that same jersey, the club made its debut in the national championship in 1900. Three years later, the Bianconeri colours, which had come from Nottingham, were in use. Five years later, the first Italian title arrived when Juve successfully beat off stiff competition from Genoa and Milanese. President AlfredoDick from Switzerland, left the club shortly afterwards following various complaints and rifts in the dressing room. He then went on to found Torino FC, bringing the best foreign players from Juventus with him. Juventus then endured some difficult years as they failed to keep pace with the new footballing superpowers of the time, Pro Vercelli and Casale.</p>

    <h2>Boniperti era...</h2>
    <button class="accordion">READ MORE</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>However, the long awaited success in Europe’s most elite competition was marred by the Heysel tragedy which took place in Brussels on 29 May 1985. Something inexplicable happened before the start of the match and 39 innocent victims lost their lives. From that moment on, football would never be the same again. The two teams decided to go ahead with the game in order to try and restore law and order, and in the end, Juventus won the cup. It was a joyless success, but the victory enabled the Bianconeri to fly to Tokyo in the winter to play in the Intercontinental Cup final. Argentinos Junior were beaten on penalties and Juve were crowned World Champions.

            Vycpalek and Carlo Parola helped form an unstoppable machine under Boniperti’s presidency but then, in 1976, Giovanni Trapattoni took over the managerial reigns. The coach from Cusano Milanino helped guide Juventus to an era of dominance by investing in young Italian players such as Zoff, Scirea, Tardelli, Cabrini, Causio, Rossi, Gentile, Furino, Anastasi and Bettega. From the 1980s onwards, Boniperti was able to sign foreigners who would go on to make world-beating contributions. The first example of this was Liam Brady, an intelligent Irish midfielder who dictated the pace of play, had passing expertise in abundance and scored valuable goals. His final strike, scored from the penalty spot in Catanzaro gave Juve their 20th Scudetto title on 16 May 1982 and enabled the club to add a second star to the shirt. The Juventus supporters were ecstatic.</p>

    <h2>Juve on top of the world...</h2>
    <button class="accordion">READ MORE</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Marcelo Lippi was managing the side and several new faces had entered the squad such as: Ferrara in defence, Paulo Sousa and Deschamps in midfield and up front, alongside Gianluca Vialli and Roberto Baggio, was an interesting young player. He had joined Juventus in the previous year from Padova, showing a notable technique and a strong personality. His name was Alessandro Del Piero, the man who would go on to rewrite all Juventus records. The following season was defined by an endless duel with Parma, who managed to overcome Juve in the UEFA cup final. However, the Bianconeri beat their rivals in the Scudetto title race and also ran out winners against them in the Coppa Italia final.</p>
